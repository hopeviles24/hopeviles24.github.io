      <h6>Website Development</h6>

      <div class="techtalk">
        I am currently a student at OTC, working diligently to obtain my Computer Science degree. In the midst of working towards this goal, I have learned so much! I have enjoyed learning how to design websites. In fact, this has been my favorite
        challenge so far, as there are so many elements that go into "coding a website." Until now, I have worked in HTML5 and worked with cascading style sheets. I am looking forward to the Spring, when I will have the opportunity to master
        JavaScript. I have gotten the opportunity to use some great tools that have been useful in using HTML5. The bootstrap elements have been great to be able to utilize JavaScript before actually learning it. Using the W3 Schools website has been
        incredibly helpful in maitaining correct code. I have used code validation consistantly to watch for any errors while devloping. I find it works best to validate code after each time anything changes. Working with git and github, has allowed
        me to learn how to effectively update and share my code with others. Of course, having a helpful teacher has given me the opportunity to successfully learn the skills needed to create websites. I am thrilled to be able to continue learning
        how to further my knowledge in this field while creating more websites!</div>
